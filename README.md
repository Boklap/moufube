# YouTube Mock-up Project

## Overview

This project focuses on demonstrating how teams build large-scale applications. While the code is written by a single developer, the development process mimics real-world team workflows and best practices.

### Architecture Decision

**Note:** This project would typically use a **polyrepo** architecture in production environments, but we've opted for a **monorepo** approach to simplify service management within a single repository during development.
